I'm using this blog to help document Hack The Box writeups and other related cybersecurity work. My goal is to focus on writing about "beyond root" content where I try to patch the box, detailing ways to prevent and detect compromise. This is not a novel concept (credit due [here](https://youtu.be/_EV2Frf5P2E?t=1504) and [here](https://youtu.be/mB-YSr9lEe0?t=1326)) but helpful with my current aspirations.

Feel free to reach out on LinkedIn.
